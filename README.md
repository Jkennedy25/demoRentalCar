# demoRentalCar
This is a Rental Car Project site I built for an assignment for my school. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, mpPHPAdmin, and bootstrap templates. Apon first opening, you are welcomed with a homescreen and has functional navigation between 5 pages. These pages include home, about us, catalog, reservations, and login. The about page consists of a paragraph describing information about the site and what we offer. Our catalog contains pictures and descriptions of multiple vehichles including year, make and model, and price. The reservation tab lets the user make reservations once created an account. You will then input your information such as name and the vehicle you want to book. Our login page allows you to either login for existing users or create an account. Password requirements are implemented such as character length and special characters. Only users that are logged in can access certain information about their account. A security protocol will be called to be able to access the site. 
The goal of this project was the functionality and not the UI. If I had more time to work on this, I would like to add more styling and make the site less static for th user.
This is an assignment that I am really proud of and wanted to showcase for anyone who would like to see or use. I know that it may not look pretty but for a starting project it gets the job done.
